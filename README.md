# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of the project is to test some new features for the PlanMyTrip app. Some of those new features include filtering the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations, nearby hotels, and using the Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route as well as a marker layer map.
